    <p id="about">Our task was to create a for-profit Social Enterprise plan which addresses a social challenge and present it to a group of potential investors.
    My team chose to create a salmon farm that would stop overfishing. We wanted to deliver healthy non-chemical Atlantic Salmon to customers hassle free.â€‹</p>
    <p id="about">My team won the contest in class and got the opportunity to present our enterprise to a group of investors as well as the rest of our Year Up colleagues.
    It was a great chance to practice my public speaking skills as well as my teamwork.</p>
